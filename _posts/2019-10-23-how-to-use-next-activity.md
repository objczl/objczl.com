## An Activity Elements:

* Date/time
* Activity description
* How I feel
* Duration
* Value (high, medium, low, none)

## How to use the Next Activity

**Step 1** Recording

 Every time you change activities, note down **what the activity is**, the time
 of the change, and **how you feel** (alert, flat, tired, energetic)

**Step 2** Evaluate your activity value

 At a convenient time, go back through your activity logs, write down the
 duration of each activity, and whether it was high, medium, low, or no
 value task. (**Evaluate** this based how far it contributed to archiving your
 job goals, and predefined, defining, undefined work)

**Step 3** Learning from the activity log

 * How much time did you spend doing low-value jobs?
 * Which parts of the day you are energetic and flat?

 Applying one of the following actions to various activities to boosts your
 productivity

 * Eliminate or delegate jobs that don’t help you meet your objectives
 * Schedule your most challenging task for the times of day when your energy
   levels are highest.
 * Reduce the amount of time you spend on legitimate personal activities (breaks)

> Don't confuse Activity Logs with Timesheets – these are used for reporting on
> your use of time, and for tracking the time you spend on a task or job.
