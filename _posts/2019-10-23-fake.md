![Tackling the fake news problem](https://cl.ly/6c85179638c6/test-double-fake.jpg)

* How can we verify logic independently **when depended-on objects cannot be
  used**?
* How can we avoid **Slow Tests**?

When you can't use a real implementation in your test (network/database). You
should use a `Fake Object` whenever our `SUT` depends on other components that are
unavailable or which make testing difficult or slow.

**Some situations:**

 * Fake Database
 * In-Memory Database
 * Fake Web Service
 * Fake Service Layer
 * “*Inject a Fake Object that implements async, but does so synchronously.*”

**Fake Service example**

```swift
protocol Service {
  func hello(_ name: String) -> String
}
```

```swift
class Greet {
  let service: Service

  init(_ service: Service) {
    self.service = service
  }

  func greeting(_ name: String) -> String {
    return self.service.hello(name)
  }
}
```

Define a Fake Object that conforms to the protocol. Inject it from test code, and use to write test cases.

```swift
struct FakeService: Service {
  func hello(_ name: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(name)"
  }
}
```

```swift
class GreetTests: XCTestCase {
  func test_greet_withWebService_shouldStartWithHello() {
    let sut = Greet(FakeService())

    let result = sut.greeting("Dummy")

    XCTAssertTrue(result.hasPrefix("Hello"))
  }
}
```
