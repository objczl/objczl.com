I want a simple and automatic tool to record my time spending. I had tried
Spreadsheet, [Doing](https://github.com/ttscoff/doing), and
[Toggle](https://toggl.com/). But all those tools don't design for Activity
Logs that good at feeling and evaluate value. As I'm an apple fun and iOS
Developer I want to build a cross-platform app by myself to keep an activity
log easily.

Next Activity App is a [time management]() tool which design for recording
activity log (*also known as activity diaries or job activity log*) and helping
you finding more time in your day.

 * Write records of how you spend your time
 * Evaluate the activity value
 * Learn from activity log, find more time in your day
