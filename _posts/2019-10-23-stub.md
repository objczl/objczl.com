* How can we verify logic independently when it depends on indirect inputs from
  other software components?

When we need defined return values from a method.  In a test, it is often useful
to have fixed hard-coded return value for a method that the SUT calls. The
test then asserts that the SUT reacts in an expected way to the defined
return value.

Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub
that remembers the messages it 'sent', or maybe only how many messages it
'sent'.

**How it works**

1. Define a test-specific implementation of an interface on which the SUT
   depends.
2. Install the Stub so that the SUT uses it instead of the real implementation.
3. Called by the SUT during test execution, the Stub returns the previously
   defined values. The test can then verify the expected outcome.

> Note: Test-driven development often causes us to create Temporary Test Stubs
> as we write code from the outside inwards; these shells evolve into the real
> classes as we add code to them.  We really should have at least one test that
> verifies it works without a Test Stub.

**Motivating Example**

```swift
protocol Service {
  func hello(_ name: String) -> String
}

class Greet {
  let service: Service

  init(_ service: Service) { self.service = service }

  func greeting(_ name: String) -> String { return self.service.hello(name) }
}
```

```swift
class StubService: Service {
  var greeting: String?

  init(with: greeting: String) { self.greeting = greeting }

  // Service interface
  func hello(_ name: String) -> String { return greeting ?? "" }
}

class StubTests: XCTestCase {
  func test_greeting_withService_shouldReturnFoo() {
    let sut = Greet(StubService(with: "foo"))

    let resut = sut.greeting("dummy")

    XCTAssertEqual(resut, "foo")
  }
}
```
