## Hello!

I’m Liang Zeng. I’m an iOS developer based in Chongqing, China. Since 2010,
with the platform since "iPhone OS 4", and with nine years total of professional
programming experience. I've written Objective-C for six years, and for the
last two years, I've been heavily focused on Swift. I’m good at Cocoa Touch to
build iPhone and iPad applications. I can build the app independently. I have
released multiple apps to the App Store.

I invest a tonne of time keeping myself up-to-date, and seek constantly to
improve the way I write code, trialing new techniques in my own side-projects.

*Keywords: Swift 5, SwiftUI, Protocol Oriented Programming, Generics, Combine,
ReactiveCocoa, MVVM + Coordinator pattern, Core Data, Fastlane, Continuous
Integration, Unit Testing (TDD).*

I use [increment design](https://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/incremental_design.html)
to write code that works and `rule of three` to refactor and improve the design. I
use git (git-flow strategy) continuously to prepare new features, before using
pull-requests to merge them in. I use CocoaPods to manage dependencies. I unit
test and employ TDD (when appropriate), to write reliable, well-structured code.

I believe **solve your own problem, everything else will follow**. As everything
that I have ever worked on, I was trying to solve my problem.  If it doesn’t
work for me, I don’t want to sell it I decided to launch it when it’s gonna look
like something that I would use every day. That was the goal.

*Skills: macOS, Linux, RESTFull API, java, JavaScript, Spring Framework

*Projects: News, Magazine, Location, iBeacon, Utilities, Business, Finance,
Enterprise*
